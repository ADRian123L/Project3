# Jumping Jim Pathfinder ðŸ”€

## Description
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm to solve the "Jumping Jim" maze problem. The program models the maze as a directed graph where each node represents a trampoline in the maze and directed edges represent possible jumps Jim can make based on the trampoline's strength. The program utilizes a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the starting point (top-left corner of the maze) to the goal (bottom-right corner).

## Requirements
To run this program, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later and `make` utility installed on your system.

## Compilation
To compile the program, navigate to the project directory where the `Makefile` is located and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make
